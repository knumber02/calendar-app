# Calendar & Map App
  I made Calendar application mixed with Map for CS'50 Final Project.
## Video Demo: url

## Description
### Setup Environment
 I use JavaScript and React and Redux, CSS in order to build UI.
 Also, I use Docker in the server side.

### User Goal
When I use the usual calendar, I realized that I wanted the more functions so that it is easy for me to schedule plans. <br> So, I come up with my idea that calendar mixed with map is the useful tools for users in order that  map helps users plan schedules by searching the location information, and then I made this application.

### Usage
When you start the this app,  you are in the top page. <br> In the top page, you just push the button in the center of page. And then, you were moved to the calendar page. You realized that this page looks like the normal calendar. For sure, you can move the previous month or next month's calendar board by pushing the arrow button in the second navigation from the top. <br> But Surprisingly, you you can post and delete your plan in the calendar board. How? <br> First, you push  any day which you can select  in the calendar board. <br> 
Second, the dialog opens up, you can add the title(the required item) and the location and the description of your schedule. When you finish to type your schedule in the dialog, push the save button in the below so that you can add the schedule. Also, you can exit the dialog if you push the X button in upper right. <br> Once you add the schedule in the above procedure, you realized that someting changed. That's right, the bar is added in calendar board so that when you clicked the bar, you can look back the saved schedule in the calendar board. <br> In addition to that, you can delete the added schedule once you push the garbage box's mark in the dialog. <br>
Next, I'm going to teach you the way you can move to another pages.<br> When looking at the top navigation, you realized that title in the left side and the the page's name in the right side.<br>
In the right side at the top navigation, you can push the letter of Top or Calendar or Map. Once pushing the letter, you were moved to the selected page.<br> Let's try to push Map, here. You were moved to map pages in a moment, and you realized that the large map was displayed on the screen.<br> In the map, your current locaion is marked in a green ballon. And zooming up, the marker of surrounding locations is emerging. And then,  you can check the information of the selected location when touching the marker of the selected location. Also, you can mark the any place in red just by clicking any place. In addition to that, once you  search any location of the whole world in the serach box in the current page's upper left side , the selected location is displayed in the map, and that location is marked in red automatically. <br>

That is all for explanations. I appreciate you read this description.
