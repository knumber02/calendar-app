# Calendar & Map App

## Video Demo: url

## Description
### Setup Environment
 I use JavaScript and React and Redux, CSS in order to build UI.
 Also, I use Docker in the server side.

### User Goal
When I use the usual calendar, I realized that I wanted the more functions so that it is easy for me to schedule plans. So, I made this app for users that have the same feelings. 

### Usage
When you start the this app,  you are in the top page.   In the top page, you just push the button in the center of page. And then, you are in the calendar page.  In the calendar page, you can post and delete your plan in the calendar board. How?  First, you push the calendar board which you can select. (Aside to that, today's board is marked as a blue circle.)
