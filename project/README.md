## Video Demo: url

## Description
### Setup Environment
 I use JavaScript and React and Redux, CSS in order to build UI.
 Also, I use Docker in the server side.

### User Goal
When I use the usual calendar, I realized that I wanted the more functions so that it is easy for me to schedule plans. So, I made this app for users that have the same feelings. 

### Usage
When you start the this app,  you are in the top page. <br> In the top page, you just push the button in the center of page. And then, you are in the calendar page.<br>In the calendar page, you can post and delete your plan in the calendar board. But, How? <br> First, you push the calendar board which you can select. (Aside to that, today's board is marked as a blue circle.) <br> 
Second, the dialog opens up, you can add the title(requirment) and the location and the description of your schedule. When you finish to type your schedule in the dialog, push the save button in the below so that you can add the schedule. Also, you can exit the dialog if you push the X button in upper right. <br> Once you add the schedule in the above procedure, you realized that someting changed. That's right, the bar is added in calendar board so that when you clicked the bar, you can look back the saved schedule in the calendar board. <br> In addition to that, you can delete the added schedule
